# Giveup

`giveup` is a tiny abstraction for wrapping and nicely displaying
`Result`s to end-users.

It is meant to be used as a replacement for `expect` or `unwrap_or_else`,
if an error occurred which terminates the program. 

## Example
```rust
// Here reading the config at the start of the cli app
// fails because the user has not yet created a config file.
let config_file = File::open("config-path")
    .hint("Create a configuration file")
    .example("touch config-filename")
    .giveup("Missing configuration file");
```

## Motivation
In the above scenario `expect` is misplaced because we don't want
the user of the CLI to be confronted with a `panic`.

To goal is to display an easily readable error message and offer
as much help as possible, so the user can get back to what
they originally intended to do (which never is fixing some issues
of the tool one is using).

My usual solution would look somewhat like this: 
```rust
let config = File::open("config-path").unwrap_or_else(|err| {
    eprintln!("Missing configuration file: {}\n\
        Create a new configuration file: `touch config-filename`",
        err);
    std::process::exit(1);
});
```

In this case the difference is not world-changing but using
`unwrap_or_else` can get pretty verbose with lots of
boilerplate repeating over and over again.
Also, `giveup` is more friendly to dynamic error messages
using variables.

## Feedback

I primarily wrote `giveup` for my personal use, so I would love
to get your [feedback](https://github.com/thass0/giveup/issues).
